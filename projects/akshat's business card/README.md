# Akshat's Business card

<!-- I am making a business card for my self which will have a QR code to scan which will lead to my website and i also have my Github handle next to it -->

<!-- Its gonna cost about 30$-->

<!-- For the design process i just followed the tutorial as I am a beginner to this. For t=me it was the electrical connections, but the feature on EasyEDA where it automatically does it for you made it easier for me as a beginner.
